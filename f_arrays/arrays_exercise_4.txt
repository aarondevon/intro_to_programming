What does each method return in the following example?
arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)

returns the index of the first object found, in this case
=> 3

2. arr.index[5]

Throws an error:
undefined method `[]' for #<Enumerator: [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]:index>

3. arr[5]

This is referencing the 5th index in the array so it returns
=> 8
