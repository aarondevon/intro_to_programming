Exercise 5: Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

and

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

The first bit of code will print 3. x starts at 0 but is incremented 3 time in the #times method.

The second code section will through an error because x was defined in a different scope. undefined local variable or method `x'


Exercise 6: What does the following error message tell you?
NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

  This error tells me that the variable or method 'shoes' can not be found. It has either not been defined yet or it was defined in a different scope.
